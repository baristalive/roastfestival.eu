We soon realised that combining a roasting space with an espresso bar wasn't going to be quite so easy - hats off to QB in Brno and Nordbeans' Dock in Liberec, but suitable venues were scarce in Brno. After we acquired our first roasting machine in early 2020, a suitable space in a historic building from the 1920s finally came up in Brno to set up shop, at least according to some of our ideas. However, the road to opening in the covid era combined with a complete renovation was thorny, and we launched a live operation in July 2021. Even before the opening of the caf√© we understood that the capacity of the roasting machine (2 kg) would not be enough. After moving to the current premises in Husovice, we purchased a Kuban machine in July 2021 - a gas roaster with a capacity of 12 kg."
