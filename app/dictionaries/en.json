      "The festival is intended for everyone who is just a little bit interested in the world of specialty coffee. It doesn't matter if you are a professional in the industry, a coffee enthusiast or if you tasted your first v60 yesterday and are just getting acquainted. And if the caffeine gets to be too much for you - the festival offers an alternative in the form of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and savoury and sweet treats."
