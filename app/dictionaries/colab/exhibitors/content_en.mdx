### Retail sale of coffee packages

At the festival, roasters can also sell their own packages of coffee for the duration of their presentation. In addition, there is the possibility to use the festival sales booth that is open for the entire duration of the festival.

Up to 4 types of coffee can be placed at the sales booth, 5 pieces each (no problem to refill during the event). Please send us at least 7 days before the event a list of coffees you wish to place at the sales booth, including the selling price and information about each coffee type.

The festival charges a fee of 20% of the selling price. At the end of the festival, we will return the rest of the packages and bill you on the spot. If you are not available until the end of the festival, we can arrange the billing and return of the packages at a later date.

### Advertisment

Up to two rollups with a maximum height of 2m can be placed behind the presentation bar, or any other form of advertisement that doesn't interfere with other presentation bars. The front face of each bar is used for information graphics display of the festival itself, therefore this place can't be used for your advertisement.

Your roaster will be placed on our website in the form of a logo, a caption, and a listing in the schedule. It will also be shared on our social media in the form of at least two regular posts and one sponsored post.

If you would be interested in other forms of advertising collaboration, please do not hesitate to contact us.
