### Technological cooperation

Are you a supplier of coffee technology, accessories or similarly emerging on the coffee scene? We need everything from coffee machines to scales to cupping spoons for the festival. We're happy to borrow these items from you and barter them according to the size of the collaboration, from promotional materials to a full festival booth or presentation slots.
Of course, you won't get away with cupping and other festival merchandise either.

At the same time, if you are importing some interesting coffee technology to the Czech Republic, we will be happy to offer you space to showcase and promote it at the festival.
