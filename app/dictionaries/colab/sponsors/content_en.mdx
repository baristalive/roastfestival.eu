### Technological cooperation

Are you a supplier of coffee technology, accessories, or equipment for the barista scene? For our upcoming festival, we are looking for everything from espresso machines to scales and cupping spoons. We would love to partner with you to borrow these items in exchange for a bespoke barter package. Depending on the scale of the collaboration, we offer everything from brand placement on promotional materials to a full festival booth or dedicated presentation slots.

As a thank you, we’ll make sure you don't leave empty-handed—expect a gift of our exclusive festival cups and other merchandise!

Additionally, if you are importing innovative coffee technology to the Czech Republic, we'd love to provide you with the perfect space to showcase and promote it to our audience.

Interested? Please get in touch via email at sponsors@roastfestival.eu.

### Other forms of cooperation
